 * What it Does:
 *   This file sets up our react app to render inside of the root html
 *   file. The global css file is included here as well as our service
 *   worker is registered.
 *
 * Things to Change:
 *   Anything outside of react that needs to be included in your project
 *   can go here. If you want additional CSS files you can include them
 *   here.
